# 🛠️ Finetune-Your-Own-Model — A Hands-On Tutorial Series

Welcome to **Finetune-Your-Own-Model**, a step-by-step guide to adapting state-of-the-art pretrained models to your specific task using the Hugging Face ecosystem.  
Whether you are working on text, vision, or multi-modal problems, this tutorial walks you through every stage—from formulating *why* you should finetune, to *how* to ship your model in production.

## 📚 Tutorial Structure

The journey is organised into six Jupyter notebooks (found in the repo root once generated):

| # | Notebook | What you’ll learn |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | `01_motivation.ipynb` | Why finetuning matters, typical scenarios, cost vs. benefit analysis. |
| 2 | `02_data_collection_and_preparation.ipynb` | Strategies for sourcing, cleaning, and structuring a **task-specific dataset**—the most critical & unique step. |
| 3 | `03_selecting_a_base_model.ipynb` | How to pick the right pretrained checkpoint (Transformer, Diffusion, etc.) based on domain, scale, and resource budget. |
| 4 | `04_training_and_finetuning.ipynb` | Writing an efficient training script with `transformers`, `datasets`, `accelerate` & 🤗 Hub integration. |
| 5 | `05_evaluation.ipynb` | Quantitative & qualitative evaluation, using `evaluate`, custom metrics, and error analysis dashboards. |
| 6 | `06_deployment_and_serving.ipynb` | Exporting, versioning, and serving your model (HF Inference Endpoints, FastAPI, TorchScript, etc.). |

## 🔧 Prerequisites

* Python ≥ 3.9  
* A machine with a CUDA-capable GPU (recommended, CPU will work but will be slower)  
* [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and a free [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join)  
* Basic familiarity with PyTorch and Jupyter notebooks

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/JBlitzar/finetune-your-own-model.git
cd finetune-your-own-model

# 2. Create & activate a virtual env (choose one)
python -m venv .venv         # standard venv
# or: conda create -n finetune python=3.10
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -U "transformers[torch]" datasets accelerate evaluate jupyter

# 4. Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab  # or: jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebooks in order and execute the cells. Each notebook contains detailed, runnable code snippets and explanatory commentary.
