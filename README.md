# 🛠️ Finetune-Your-Own-Model — A Hands-On Tutorial Series

Welcome to **Finetune-Your-Own-Model**, a step-by-step guide to adapting state-of-the-art pretrained models to your specific task using the Hugging Face ecosystem.  
Whether you are working on text, vision, or multi-modal problems, this tutorial walks you through every stage—from formulating *why* you should finetune, to *how* to ship your model in production.

## 📚 Tutorial Structure

This project now uses **one comprehensive Jupyter notebook**:

* **`finetune_your_own_model.ipynb`** – a single, self-contained tutorial that walks you through the entire workflow:
  1. Motivation for fine-tuning vs. training from scratch  
  2. Collecting & preparing a task-specific dataset  
  3. Selecting an appropriate base model (text, vision, audio, …)  
  4. Writing the training / fine-tuning script with `transformers`, `datasets`, and `accelerate`  
  5. Evaluating your model with built-in and custom metrics  
  6. Deployment options: local inference, FastAPI, Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, and model optimisation techniques  

> 💡 **Skip around freely** – each section in the notebook is clearly labelled, so you can jump straight to the part you need.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

* Python ≥ 3.9  
* A machine with a CUDA-capable GPU (recommended, CPU will work but will be slower)  
* [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and a free [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join)  
* Basic familiarity with PyTorch and Jupyter notebooks

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/JBlitzar/finetune-your-own-model.git
cd finetune-your-own-model

# 2. Create & activate a virtual env (choose one)
python -m venv .venv         # standard venv
# or: conda create -n finetune python=3.10
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -U "transformers[torch]" datasets accelerate evaluate jupyter

# 4. Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab  # or: jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebooks in order and execute the cells. Each notebook contains detailed, runnable code snippets and explanatory commentary.
